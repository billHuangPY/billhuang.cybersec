# Overview
## CYBERSEC 2020, WORLD-CLASS CYBERSECURITY CONFERENCE X EXPO
AUG 11-12, 2020 at Taipei Nangang Exhibition Center, Hall 2

On Aug. 12 and 11, 2020, CyberSec was held by ITHome. This is my first time attending this kind of conference event as an engineer from a tech company.
It's a highly valuable chance that I can be the only person of my department to participate the event.
I joined six forums in total on Aug. 12. The catogories of them are quite in variety, from hardware to software, from basic skills to security strategies of an organization.

I briefly recorded the forum and implement the lab if it is possible.
