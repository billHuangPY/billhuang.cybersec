# CYBERSEC2020(VI) - Cyber Security Strategy: Use Framework to relief real threats
Informed by Allen Own, Aaron Chung, DevCore Security Consulting

# Overview
-   Is your company safe ?
-   Quick understanding about position and definition cyber security
-   Use case sample to explain strategy hand in hand
-   Perform real situation by risk responding

# Cyber Security Strategy

## = To-do list with "priority" (short, mid, long term)
## = What a company need to "continuously handle" "after" "importing" defensive measures

# What a company should know about its cyber security status

## Is it safe ? (NOW)
### Implementation for a company
-   Having progress with cyber security. 
-   Keep doing enhancement in multiple areas to increase business performance and decrease damages when facing risks.

## What risk is it facing ? (NOW and FUTURE)
### Main risks
-   Having small risk influences from new supply company
-   Other enormous risks are all under control
### External environment
-   How to respond possible events from the outside
-   Ex: Ransomeware, information leakage, service interruption

## What resource does it need ? (NOW and FUTURE)
### Cyber security strategy
-   Having huge goal about security strategy operation
-   Keep enhancing maturity about the process, exceeding the standard and approaching its goal
### Recommandation
-   Recording current status and approving action plan

# Strategy

## Short term: Recover
### 1.  Handle current status
### 2.  Emergency treatment, making the damage in minimum area
### 3.  Investigate and analyze the reason it happened
### 4.  Fix the problem and recover it
### 5.  Develope Countermeasure, preventing that it happens again
### Example:
-   Cyber Security Incident investigation result
-   Weekly Audit result
-   Weekly Top10 block information of appliances
-   Monthly Single Pass Stastics table
-   Management review meeting

## Mid term: Nip it in the bud
### 1.  Define issues that "possibly" have "impact" to business operation
### 2.  Identify the reason of issues
### 3.  Think about countermeasure of "preventing" issues
### 4.  Think about countermeasure when the issue happening
### Example:
-   Ransomeware causes service interruption
-   Attack innovates
-   Upgrade the appliance to newest version
-   Arrange continuously running plan of company

## Long term: Pursue the ideal
### 1.  Check and analyze the pros and cons of issues
### 2.  Set ideal target of company
### 3.  Arrange action plan to achieve the ideal
### Example:
-   Due to the limitation of resources, we can't even finish the prevention, not to mention ideal goal


# Not able to handle impacts of incidents
-   all is imagination and uncertainty

## Replace "ideal" with "plan ahead"
### Example:
-   Cyber security's assistance for a company
-   Availability evaluation of budgets
-   Priority of continuously arrangement about cyber security resource

# Security Strategy build the base on Security Framework, adjust with real threats

# Position of Framework and Standards
## ISO 27001:2013
-   Building standards of security managing system. Help manage the organization and protect the assets. Ensure to accomplish the expectation of clients or stakeholder. Can be verified
-   Decrease the risk of business, increase commercial trust, help run the business
![isochart](/assets/ISOchart.png)

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework v1.1
-   Network Security Framework: provide key basis facilities or common company with assistance of organization management and protection of information assets. To make sure the safety. Can be verified
-   Provide Structured method to enhance the maturity of organization security
![NIST-framework](/assets/NIST-Framework.png)

## CIS CSC v7.1
-   Guideline of security control: Provide priority order list against the control measurement of network attack, and provide operation advice followed by IG1-IG3
-   classified with "Basic", "Foundamental", and "Organizational", 20 control groups, and 178 control items.

## OWASP Cyber Defense Matrix

## Evaluate more enhancement possibility by current basis
-   Based on current standard or framework
-   Complement with view of the same type, Ex: CSF - 27001
-   Correspond support process from control measure, Ex: CSC - 27001
-   Make up the disadvantages of technique layer by appliances and service

# All a consultant can do is to provide method, nobody else can understand the company itself.

## CIS CSC combined with CDM

# Case Study

## Countermeasure from control layer to process layer
-   find the lacking process
-   discover defense item needed to be enhance
-   only if appliance + process + procedure can reduce the possibility of vulnerability reusing.

## Respond to risk evaluation

## Security Level

# Takeways
-   Cyber Security is not to meet emergency(SHORT), but to plan further(MID, LONG)
-   Strategy is important, make good use of framework tools to set long-term securty strategy
-   Plan from upper layer to lower layer; enhance, review from lower layer to upper layer
-   Framework and Standard have no absolute, the point is the method
